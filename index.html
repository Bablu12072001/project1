                The <b style="color: green"> employee onboarding process</b> for
                bringing in new hires involves many moving parts, including
                plenty of paperwork and documentation. <br />
                These onboarding documents serve a range of purposes and may
                slightly vary depending on your company’s policies or its
                industry, but there are certain documents all businesses must
                collect from every new team member it brings on. <br />
                Some of these documents are required by the government for tax
                or compliance purposes, while others are required by your
                company for various administrative purposes. Because all this
                paperwork can pile up, it will be greatly beneficial to provide
                every document to new employees as part of a package on, or
                before, their first day – and generally it’s best to do in a
                digital, paperless form.k
                <br />
                This package should be reviewed, signed, and promptly returned
                to the human resources department for review to avoid any
                trouble down the line.

              <h2>Common Types of Onboarding Documents</h2>
              <p>
                New hire onboarding documents serve a variety of purposes that
                benefit your company, satisfy government requirements, and
                provide vital information to your new team members. <br />
                The abundance of paperwork can be daunting at first – however,
                it is easier to handle the more familiar with them you become.
                For the most part, all onboarding paperwork for new employees
                should fit into just a handful of categories which we’ve
                outlined for you below:
              </p>
              <ul class="list">
                <li>
                  <b>Legal & Tax Forms:</b> These documents are required by
                  either the state or federal government and sare absolutely
                  mandatory. Documents such as the W-4 or I-9 forms legally must
                  be completed within days of an employee’s start date,
                  otherwise, your company could be subject to fines or other
                  penalties in the event of an audit.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <b>Role-Specific Documents: </b> This category includes forms
                  and informational documents that detail the expectations of
                  your new employee, as well as
                  <a
                    href=""
                    style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(88, 124, 5)"
                  >
                    standard operating procedures (SOPs)</a
                  >
                  and
                  <a
                    href=""
                    style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(88, 124, 5)"
                  >
                    policy and procedure manuals</a
                  >
                  . This is to ensure that all parties are informed and on the
                  same page from the very start on what is expected of them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Company-Specific Documents:</b> Company-specific documents
                  should cover all the information your new employee will need
                  to thrive in their new role with your company. These types of
                  onboarding documents include things such as
                  <a
                    href=""
                    style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(88, 124, 5)"
                  >
                    employee handbooks</a
                  >
                  , mission statements, and organizational charts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Pay & Benefits Forms:</b> These documents should be
                  designed to educate your employee about how they will be paid
                  and can take advantage of your company’s benefits, as well as
                  collect all information necessary to set those wheels in
                  motion. These could include documents such as time-off
                  policies, 401k information, health benefit packets, stock
                  option documents, and more.

              <h2>Legal & Tax Onboarding Documents</h2>
              <p>
                Here are a few of the most common legal and tax documents new
                hires will need to receive and complete during or before their
                onboarding.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b> W-4 Form</b>
                  <p>
                    The W-4 form prompts employees to determine how much should
                    be withheld from their paychecks for federal income taxes.
                    This form is necessary for payroll processing and is
                    required by the government, so copies should be kept on file
                    for at least four years as they may be requested by the IRS
                    for review.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Certain states use specific versions of this form, but many
                    use the publicly available federal document, so be sure to
                    check the requirements for your state.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Employment I-9 Form</b>
                  <p>
                    With this document, new hires declare their eligibility to
                    work in the United States and provide proof of that
                    eligibility with documentation such as a passport or a
                    Social Security card. The I-9 form has a section that must
                    be completed by both the employer and the new team member,
                    and must be completed by both parties within the first three
                    days of employment to avoid penalty.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>State Withholding Certificate</b>
                  <p>
                    Certain states require withholding forms such as the W-4
                    specifically for state taxes. Unless your state does not
                    require an income tax, this form will determine how much
                    should be withheld from your new employees’ paychecks for
                    state taxes.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <br />
                <li>
                  <b> Drug-Testing Records</b>
                  <p>
                    Not all companies require drug testing, but depending on
                    your company’s policies, laws in your state, and your
                    industry, your onboarding paperwork may need to include a
                    copy of your drug testing policy – along with records of
                    test results in accordance with any governmental or industry
                    compliance regulations.

              <p>
                Here are a few of the most common role-specific onboarding
                documents new hires should receive during their onboarding
                process.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b> Employment Offer Letter</b>
                  <p>
                    The employment offer letter describes the expectations of
                    your new employee’s role in detail and outlines important
                    information on their pay and benefits. The offer letter
                    should be reviewed and signed by the employee, and later
                    kept in the employee file for reference in the case of any

                  <p>
                    The employment contract is a formal agreement that spells
                    out the responsibilities of a new employee within the role
                    they’ve been hired for. This is signed after the initial
                    employment agreement and is important for ensuring a mutual
                    understanding of important details about the job.

                    Any additional information about your new employee’s job
                    expectations and responsibilities not included in their
                    employment offer letter or employment contract form should
                    also be provided in writing as part of their onboarding
                    package. This may include goal-setting worksheets,

                    Not all companies require drug testing, but depending on
                    your company’s policies, laws in your state, and your
                    industry, your onboarding paperwork may need to include a
                    copy of your drug testing policy – along with records of
                    test results in accordance with any governmental or industry
                    compliance regulations.

              <h2>Company-Specific Onboarding Documents</h2>
              <p>
                Here are a few of the most common company-specific onboarding
                documents new hires should expect to receive.
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b> Employee Handbook</b>
                  <p>
                    Some information about employee expectations is less
                    role-specific, and can be covered by a company-wide employee
                    handbook. This document should be all-encompassing and
                    include details that all employees should be familiar with,
                    such as your company’s behavioral policies, dress code, or
                    emergency procedures.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <img src="images/5.png" class="img1" alt="" />
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is helpful to have employees sign an acknowledgment form
                    stating that they have familiarized themselves with the
                    contents of the employee handbook.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Organizational Chart</b>
                  <p>
                    Every new employee should be provided with an organizational
                    chart so they can become familiar with how your company is
                    structured, as well as understand who reports to whom and
                    who they should contact in different situations. Depending
                    on the size of your company, you may need to provide a
                    streamlined version that lists department leaders rather
                    than every single employee.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b> Risk Management Policy</b>
                  <p>
                    Employers should also provide a risk management policy that
                    breaks down their policies in response to specific risk
                    situations such as workplace accidents or lawsuits, as well
                    as environmental disasters. This document should also note
                    the methods that the company will use to identify potential
                    risks for transparency purposes.
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <b> Brand Guidelines</b>
                  <p>
                    Employees should be provided with a brand guideline document
                    for communicating with other employees and with the public
                    in relation to your company. This document should include
                    guidelines for all aspects of your business’ identity
                    including voice, colors, logos, and even fonts.
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/logoes/10.png" class="img1" alt="" />
                  <p>
                    Ensuring that employees are representing your company in
                    accordance with these guidelines will ensure that your
                    business is portrayed in the most appropriate light and help
                    establish consistency for how your brand appears.

                <li>
                  <b> Emergency Contact Form</b>
                  <p>
                    All new team members should provide emergency contact
                    information including their contact’s name, phone number,
                    email, and relationship to the employee when they start
                    working for your company. This information should be kept in
                    the employee file for safety and liability purposes.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Non-Compete Agreement Contract</b>
                  <p>
                    If your company has enacted non-compete or non-disclosure
                    policies, new employees should be informed and required to
                    provide a signed acknowledgment upon hiring. These documents
                    will likely be very specific to your business if you have
                    them at all, but they can be crucial for guarding against
                    issues with intellectual property disputes or employee
                    poaching from your competitors.
